1.Explain the differences between SQL and MySQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language):
             =>SQL is a standard programming language used to manage and interact with relational databases. It defines how to query, insert, update, delete, and manage data in a database.
            =>SQL is a language used across various database systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle) to perform operations on data.
            =>SQL is a language or standard used for database queries and management. It is not a software or tool.
            =>SQL provides the syntax and commands (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.) used to manipulate data in any relational database system.
            =>SQL is universal and works with many database systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.
            =>SQL is a standardized language maintained by ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization). Different databases implement SQL according to this standard, but there may be minor variations (like T-SQL for SQL Server or PL/SQL for Oracle).
MySQL:
            =>MySQL is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that uses SQL to interact with databases. It is software that allows users to create, maintain, and manage databases, using SQL as its query language.
            =>MySQL is a database management system that helps store, organize, and retrieve data efficiently. It uses SQL as the means to communicate with the database.
            =>MySQL is a software or system (RDBMS) that implements SQL to store, retrieve, and manage data.
            =>MySQL uses SQL to execute queries and manage databases, but it also provides additional features like user management, security, storage engine configuration, and performance tuning.
            =>MySQL is a specific database system that supports SQL as its query language.
            =>MySQL follows the SQL standard but may introduce additional features or minor syntactical variations unique to MySQL.
            =>MySQL provides the infrastructure (the actual database system) to store, retrieve, and manage data, and SQL is the language used to interact with it.
2.Difference Between the SQL And T-Sql
SQL (Structured Query Language) and T-SQL (Transact-SQL) are both query languages used to interact with databases, but they differ in terms of capabilities, syntax, and the environments in which they are used. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key differences:
SQL (Structured Query Language):
SQL is a standard language used for querying and managing relational databases. It is ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) compliant.
SQL is used across various database systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and others.
SQL is primarily used for querying and manipulating database objects like tables, views, and indexes. It includes standard operations like:
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, etc.
It focuses on Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML), and Data Control Language (DCL) tasks.

1. Spring IOC Container 
      The IOC (Inversion of Control) container in Spring is a core concept responsible 
for managing the lifecycle and dependencies of objects, known as beans.
It helps implement Dependency Injection (DI), which means that the control of creating 
and managing objects is transferred from the application code to the Spring framework.

   the IOC container helps achieve loose coupling between objects by handling their creation, 
lifecycle, and dependencies, making the code cleaner and easier to test.
